# Desktop-and-Mobile-Development
This repository contains my projects and experiments with Kivy for developing cross-platform applications in Python. It includes both desktop and mobile applications, demonstrating UI design, interactive elements, and animations. The goal is to master Kivy and build functional, responsive applications.
